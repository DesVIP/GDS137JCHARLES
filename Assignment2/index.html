 <p><b>My name is Jordan Charles, I am someone who enjoys everything about video games and the culture behind it all. I have been playing video games since I was 4 years old, and the impact that it had on my life changed everything for me. The amount of friends that I have made and the emotions that I felt because of the genre made me truly believe that video games can make an impact not only on people, but the world itself. With the amount of games that I have played in my life, I wanted to take my love for games to the next level, which is making my own games for people to enjoy. I always admired how game developers had certain skills and assets to make their worlds a reality for all to see and wished that one day I could do the same. The 2 goals that I have for myself is to make a game that I can be proud of and my other goal is to have my games become a favorite for at least 100 people.

    Aside from video games, I am someone who enjoys learning about new things and getting to know people. Even if the skills that I'm willing to learn have no use for the future, I still enjoy the fact of learning something new and putting it into practice in many different fields. I especially enjoy sharing what I know with different people so that they could learn something they probably never would have known, and for them to hopefully do the same with me or others. Another fact about me is that I have a strong passion for music and art. While this may have been realized when I was young playing video games, I learned to appreciate many different kinds of art that are in different genres, the same also goes for music as well. I am someone who is pretty easygoing and enjoys many different things in life, but if it was not for video games, I don't think I would have been the same person I am today.
